# AstroMatch

Description Short: A competitive match three game of intergalactic proportions! Truly an AstroBlast!
Description Long: Description Long: In AstroMatch, you're pitted against a computer in a competitive match three game. Each player starts with a timer that ticks down. Quickly match three or more pieces together to add to your time and subtract time from your opponents'. The more pieces you match, the more time you get and the more punishment your opponents will receive! The player's game is over when their timer reaches zero, so be the last one standing to win! But watch out! Your opponent will match quicker over time! Don't worry, though. The time it takes to match pieces decreases over time, too, so while every game starts off casual and the time it takes to match is slow, everything speeds up as the game goes on! Can you survive to be the last one standing?!
