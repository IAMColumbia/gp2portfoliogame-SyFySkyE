- Some tuning
- Added music, SFX
- Added a partially visible bar behind each grid that lowers and changes color based on how much time is left for that player.
	- Built dyanmically so the color changes based on what the original maxValue was
	- Takes out the need to look at time left. Pretty much just for spectator
- Made number pop linger a bit longer
- AI gets faster, so does matching speed for all palyers as game goes on
	- Made sure neither values fall below 0
- Separating GameManager from win and lose canvases, putting that respsonbility in player classes (PlayerState)
- Separating GameTimer from player so we can have players without gametimers
- Can now have an arbitary number of players
	- CHanging exposed playerfields to be a list
		- Changed exposed list to look through children and adding every player (UnityGrid) it sees
	- Matching goes through the list of subtracts everyone ecept the player
		- Gave each player an ID so we add so when someone matches we add time to their's but subtract everyone else's
- Games now end when one player is left
- More more time before enemy move increase.
